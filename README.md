# Duckery, developer's best friend.

The rubber duck method refers to the action of talking out a problem to a rubber duck the same way you would to a person. Through talking about the problem with your trusty duck, you will actually answer your own question! This method is well known throughout the coding community, which is why we have created a platform for anyone to create their own virtual rubber duck. We hope you enjoy it, and we ensure this method will provide stress relief and answers to your conflicts, questions, and bugs!

## Coming soon...


Duck achievements, duck stats, settings, and a duck voting system.

Duck achievements will be set for different challenges in our system.

Duck stats will show how many ducks you've created, how many customizations you've used, and how many achievements you've aquired.

Settings will allow user preference on certain things like visability of your duck, username change, etc

Duck voting will allow other users to view, compare, and rate your customized duck! There will be a leaderboard for the higher rated ducks, so people can show off their coding buddy!
